# conky
my conky config

I have a right column with time, calendar, system info and some stats.
There is also a small Weather Underground API-driven config setup on the bottom left of my desktop for forecasts.
The weather config is driven by Ruby based on a config from https://github.com/alexbel/conky.

The configs are setup for WQHD resolution.
I'll add a more complete config when I can get to it.
